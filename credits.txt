Hey!

It's ya girl 
Melon/s_lfurica

please don't delete this .txt file... this is important.

I'm probably going to use some blue soul code by Sawby08, as I truly am not bothered to... make my own LOL 
Asuls for helping fix a problem with loading different enemies...

For the template fight, There may be some spoilers for UNDERTALE: Efflorescit. 
I'm making this engine so I can demo and show the coders what I mean!

Any and all resources that aren't made by Temmie Chang or Toby Fox, or are fonts... are made by ME, SULF.

In future, i may make a Japanese version of this engine for those who want it~! (probably no-one)

Thanks for reading, and be sure to stay tuned.
